            "Cut out shapes, then stamp each with a decorative motif if desired. Sprinkle with caster sugar and chill in the fridge for a further 20 minutes. Use flat plates to avoid the biscuits bending and separate with cling film if stacking on top of each other so they won't stick together.",
            "Bake in oven for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack."
